# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Uri Shaked (Wokwi)"      # Your name
  title:        "Game of Life - Cell Neighbor Count"      # Project title
  description:  "Logic to decide about the fate of a cell in the game of life: die, stay alive, or spring to life"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "The 8 inputs represent the current state of the neighboring cells (0 = dead, 1 = alive). The fate of the cell is in bits 2 and 3 of the output. The cell will be alive if either bit 2 is on and it was alive in the previous generation, or if bit 3 is on. Otherwise, it'll die."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Connect 8 DIP switches to the 8 input pins, and LEDs to bits 2 and 3 of the output. Observe the value of the output bits: bit 2 should be on when either two or three of the DIP switches are on, and bit 3 should be on when exactly three DIP switches are on."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
